# Decoment

## Description
Decoment is a C program that acts as a Linux filter, removing comments from C source code. It reads text from the standard input stream, removes comments, and writes the modified text to the standard output stream. This program handles the de-commenting task by replacing comments with spaces while preserving line numbering and string/character literal boundaries.
