# Seam Carver

## Description

The Seam Carver project involves implementing a content-aware image resizing technique called seam carving. The goal is to reduce the size of an image while preserving important features. Seam carving is a powerful method that intelligently removes or adds pixels along seams, which are paths of least importance in the image, to achieve the desired resizing effect. The project is implemented in Java and includes creating a data type that can resize an image using the seam carving technique. One of the key components is the `SeamCarver` class, which contains the implementation of the seam carving algorithm. It leverages dynamic programming and energy calculations to identify and remove the least significant seams from the image, resulting in a resized image that maintains important visual content.

## Technologies Used

- Java programming language

## File Descriptions

- `SeamCarver.java`: Contains the implementation of the `SeamCarver` class, which resizes an image using the seam carving technique.

Note: This project was completed as part of a collaboration with a partner.
